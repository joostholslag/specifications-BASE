== Purpose

This document provides an overview of the openEHR architecture in terms of a model overview, key global semantics, deployment and integration architectures, relationship to published standards, and finally the approach to building Implementation Technology Specifications (ITSs). Semantics specific to each information, archetype and service model are described in the relevant specification.

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
