= Overview

The openEHR Base Types (`org.openehr.base_types` package) consists of basic types used globally throughout the openEHR components and specifications, including definitions, various enumerations, identifier types and terminology-related types. The latter two categories are intended to support all kinds of references (to terminology terms, informational objects, real world entities).

The package structure is illustrated below.
