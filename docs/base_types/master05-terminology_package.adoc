= Terminology Package

== Overview

One type is provided among the `base_types` package to represent a reference to a 'terminology code', i.e. a code within a 'terminology'. This is sometimes called a 'concept code' among terminology builders.

The assumption here is that the 'code' is a reference to a referenceable entity within a terminology or ontology, which may be:

* a single 'term', for which a definition and potentially relationships (at least the IS-A relationship);
* a 'value set' i.e. a set of single terms, possibly in a tree or other structure corresponding to relationships between the member terms;
* any other terminological entity referencable with a code.
