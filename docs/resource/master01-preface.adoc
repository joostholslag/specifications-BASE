* Academic groups using openEHR;
* Solution vendors;
* Medical informaticians and clinicians interested in health information.

* The {openehr_overview}[openEHR Architecture Overview^].

== Status

The content of this specification were separated out from the {openehr_rm_103_common}[RM 1.0.3 Common IM specification^], in order to allow re-use by any openEHR component.

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {openehr_resource}[{openehr_resource}^].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:

*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)

== Feedback

Feedback may be provided on the {openehr_technical_list}[technical mailing list^].

Issues may be raised on the {component_prs}[specifications Problem Report tracker^].

To see changes made due to previously reported issues, see the {component_history}[{component} component Change Request tracker^].

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
