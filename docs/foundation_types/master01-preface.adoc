== Purpose

This document describes the openEHR Foundation Types, a collection of built-in and library types whose semantics are assumed by all other openEHR specifications.

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Research groups using openEHR, {iso_13606}[ISO 13606^], archetypes and related technologies;
* The open source healthcare community;
* Solution vendors.

== Previous Versions

This specification is based on the types orginally defined in the {openehr_rm_103_support}[openEHR Support Information Model from Release 1.0.3 of the Reference Model^]. Some changes have been made as follows.

=== Interval types

The additional types `Point_interval` and `Proper_interval` have been added, to support the common need for a point value and a proper interval to be specified as substitutable types. The types `Multiplicity_interval` and `Cardinality` have been added, from the {openehr_am_aom2}[AOM2 specification^].

=== Functional meta-types

A collection of meta-types representing routines, procedures and functions has been added, to support specifications that need to use these concepts.
